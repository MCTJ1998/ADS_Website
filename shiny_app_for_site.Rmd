## Shiny app for College Comparison: Shortlist

This app was the result of a collaborative project between my classmates Shannon Dohr, Jayden West and Kellie Stellmach for our COMP-112 final project. 

The app works as a search engine designed to help prospective college students narrow down their search of liberal arts schools, as well as visualize college characteristics to compare how they differ among colleges across the United States.
